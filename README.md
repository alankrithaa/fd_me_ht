- Developing a Quality Diversity (QD) framework, aiming to achieve a 30% reduction in computational overhead
while maintaining high-fidelity text-to-image synthesis.

- Designing and executing statistical experiments to validate model improvements, achieving a ~0.6 effect size gain through
rigorous hypothesis testing.
